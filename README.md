# Objective
Demonstrate use of Java + JSP, JSTL, Maven and Tomcat. This project calculates delegate allocation for a single caucus precinct.


NOTE: __This calculator ignores several cases__ (i.e. ties requiring specific rounding rules, coin flips, etc.). Going into the specifics of caucus delegate allocation would have been beyond the scope of the exercise (and a quick search didn't turn up any official rules from the IDP).
